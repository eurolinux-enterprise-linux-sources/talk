talk:
	- support word-wrap. maybe. It's not clear what this means or how it
	  should work if each end has a different width of screen.
	- handle backspacing intelligently.
	- there are reports that it sometimes goes into a one-line-only 
	  mode where it only prints to the top line of the screen. I can't 
	  reproduce this, I'm afraid... insight welcome.
	- someone should figure out some way to determine whether 8-bit
	  input is meant to be carrying a meta-modifier bit or be text.

talkd:
	- talk request messages should check for 8 bit tty and not 
	  clear to 7 bits.
	- doesn't log flash attempts.
